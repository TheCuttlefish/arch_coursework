- encapsulating player functionanilty into player made game class more clean and easy to read
- making player input class - made code more clean
- thinking to add draw forloops so that objects can subscibe if they need to be drawn
- input is very useful
- I'm trying to keep GAME class as empty as possible ( so that all data, functions are done else where), game is for main interaction.... if that makes sense
- so I keep objects that I need to draw in a list, that simplifies the code a lot
- I had to create Entity Abstract class to achieve that ( with virtual method)
- which is useful , again entity class can hide some of the common funcitnality such as positions and texture and active etc.
- I've places all the update objefcts in list so it's to manage them. do I need garbage collecttion ?
- added pause - it was a bit diff, due to input , but that was easy because input class allows that
- removed base.update(gameTime); and  base.Draw(gameTime); I'm not using XNA components
- distance collision
- tags to distinguis the objects
- refactored collision
- maybe I should add canCollide true/false state, and only check collision for objects that can collide ( no particles )
- or have collision List
- fonts are working ( just need to import spritefont and that's all) XNA is not so flexible with font sizes, so I may make a class for that.
- made a Mathf class for maths functions. Distance, lerp, clamp etc. ( c# already had Math class, but not enough functions)
