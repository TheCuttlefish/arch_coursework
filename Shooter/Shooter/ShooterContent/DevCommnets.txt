- encapsulating player functionanilty into player made game class more clean and easy to read
- making player input class - made code more clean
- thinking to add draw forloops so that objects can subscibe if they need to be drawn
- input is very useful
- I'm trying to keep GAME class as empty as possible ( so that all data, functions are done else where), game is for main interaction.... if that makes sense
- so I keep objects that I need to draw in a list, that simplifies the code a lot
- I had to create Entity Base class to acieve that
- which is useful , again entity class can hide some of the common funcitnality such as positions and texture and active etc.
